## By Freddy Silber

### Demo Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg42yMQ6dxI

## What:
- A personal portfolio site built with React and Rails API to host information about me, my projects, skills, and current interests

## Getting Started:
1. Run ```npm i``` to install dependencies
2. Run ```rails db:migrate``` to migrate the Sqlite3 / Postgres database
3. Boot this app using 'Foreman' gem with this command: ```$ foreman start -p 3000``` or ```$ rake start```.
- This will start the Rails server and the react app in our 'client' directory together.
