## What
- A personal portfolio site built with React and Rails API to host information about me, my projects, skills, and current interests

## Getting Started
1. ```cd``` into the frontend folder
2. Run ```npm i``` to install dependencies
3. ```cd``` into the backend folder
4. Run ```rails db:migrate``` to migrate the Sqlite3 / Postgres database
5. Boot this app using the 'Foreman' gem with this command: ```$ rake start``` - This will start the Rails server and the react app in our 'client' directory together
